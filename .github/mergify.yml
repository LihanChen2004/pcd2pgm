            @{{author}}, all pull requests must be targeted towards the `main` development branch.
            Once merged into `main`, it is possible to backport to @{{base}}, but it must be in `main`
            to have these changes reflected into new distributions.

            @{{author}}, your PR has failed to build. Please check CI outputs and resolve issues.
            You may need to rebase or pull in `main` due to API changes (or your contribution genuinely fails).
